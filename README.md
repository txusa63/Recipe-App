# Recipe-App
A MERN stack application that retrieves recipe data from an api and allows that data to be stored to a personal database (Mongo).
The data is fetched by entering the first letter of a recipe, all recipe names with that letter are retrieved, and each recipe name can be displayed as a recipe card by clicking on the name. The user has the option of storing that information in a database for later use by clicking a save button on the card. The user also has the ability of removing any recipe from the database by clicking a delete button on the saved cards.
